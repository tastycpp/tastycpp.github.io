Subclause 22.4 describes the tuple library that provides a tuple type as the
class template tuple that can be instantiated with any number of arguments. Each
template argument specifies the type of an element in the tuple. Consequently,
tuples are heterogeneous, fixed-size collections of values. An instantiation of
tuple with two arguments is similar to an instantiation of pair with the same
two arguments. See 22.3.
