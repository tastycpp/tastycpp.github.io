Programming is an art of managing resources of the computer. This art is similar
to the art of writing a fiction novel, which requires two parts: the content and
the form.

**The content** is what your program is doing, similar to what happens in the
novel.

**The form** is how you express this behavior, similar to the writing style of
the novel's author. The form to a great extend is driven by the taste of the
programmer, but also a programming language he uses. Some programming languages
allow to express the same behavior in multiple ways. Some languages are more
restrictive. But with no doubt the taste plays a crucial role.

Many language are mostly form oriented. They favor the form over the content.
This very much matters in a large-scale enterprise projects where frictionless
collaboration among hundreds of contributors is a top priority. Such languages
are usually perceived as high-level languages (all dynamic and some compiled
languages).

The content is important for performance. For a given task fine-tune the memory
layout and execution exactly as you want. Such languages are perceived as
low-level languages.

C++ is probably the best example of two worlds.
